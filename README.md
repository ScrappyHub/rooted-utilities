# ⚡ ROOTED Utilities & Infrastructure — Water, Power, Waste & Civic Systems

A civic infrastructure awareness vertical in the ROOTED OS.

This vertical is **informational**, not a billing or control system.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Includes:

- Public info for water, power, gas utilities
- Service areas & contact information
- Waste & recycling programs
- Infrastructure repair & project awareness
- Planned outages & maintenance notices (when integrated)

ROOTED Utilities is **NOT**:

- A billing portal
- An outage ticketing system
- A SCADA or control system
- A political or advocacy platform

It is an **awareness layer** that helps residents understand infrastructure around them.
